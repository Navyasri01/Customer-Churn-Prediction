# Customer-Churn-Prediction

ðŸ§¾ Project Overview â€“ Customer Churn Prediction

Objective:
Build a machine learning classification model to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop using the service), using demographic, account, and service-related data.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

    Dataset Name: Customer_data

    Features Include:

        Demographics: Gender, SeniorCitizen, Tenure, etc.

This bar plot shows the distribution of customers who churned vs. those who stayed.

    No (Non-Churned): Majority of customers stayed with the company.

    Yes (Churned): A smaller portion of customers left.

    This imbalance highlights the need to handle class imbalance during model training to avoid biased predictions.
